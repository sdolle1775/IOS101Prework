Chess Video Game- a game app that looks to reinvent traditional Chess by implementing video game elements to create a progression based game system in which the user challenges AI opponents while "upgrading" their chess pieces to do unconventional chess moves. Inspired by Balatro and online chess variants (Fog of War, Atomic Chess), the core of the game will revolve around a rouge-like system where the user starts with all regular chess pieces with standard moves and faces subsequently harder AI opponents. The users earns and spends points to upgrade their chess pieces (upgraded Knight can move twice, upgraded Rook is not defeated on first capture, etc.) while the AI opponents do the same. Game is over when player loses, implements a high score system.
